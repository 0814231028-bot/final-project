                Fun Facts: 
                <br>
                Hamsters are nocturnal. Nocturnal means they are most active at night.
                <br>
                They are solitary animals, beware of putting two hamsters together.
                <br>
                Roborovski or Robo hamsters, are the hardest to tame!
                <br>
                Some hamsters can run six miles every night, which is why a wheel is a must have.
