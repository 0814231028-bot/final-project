            Full Cheeks: Paper Bedding, Dust Bath Powder, Wooden Chewing Sticks
            <br>
            <br>
            Odorless paper bedding are great for hamsters as they can be sensitive to any odor that is mixed with bedding products.
            The dust bath powder helps hamsters clean out any oil their fur may have collected. It also keeps it soft.
            Wooden chewing sticks are helpful for wearing down their teeth so they don't get too long. It also satisfies
            their urge and or instinct to chew.

        <p>Kaytee: Critter Trail Line, Scented Bedding
           <br>
           <br>
           Critter Trail Lines are small cages that stress out hamsters. It does not offer any sort of momentum within the cage.
           A hamster can only afford to run back and forth inside. The scented bedding can irritate a hamster's sense of smell.
           They are territorial animals and the scented bedding can also start to stress them out. Hamsters need odorless
           bedding so that they can mark their homes.
